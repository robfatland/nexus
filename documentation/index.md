# documentation


This section of `nexus` really serves two ideas: `documentation` as a task within a workflow and how to make that
smoother and faster; and then *documentation* as a philosophical topic.

## Tactical documentation


### top and time


This section is on timing code execution and evaluating whether we are using the full power of a computer.


### [flameshot](https://flameshot.org/)


[flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) is a free open source screen capture application. It is helpful in creating
documentation. 


Installing flameshot on Windows you will want to know two things: 


- You may need to **start** the app; whereupon find its icon in the application tray (usually lower right: taskbar)
- You may need to unbind the `print screen` key so that you can trigger flameshot with that key.


**What's the deal with flameshot?** Answer: It works by creating a screencap window with a ton of
useful controls; so you can mark up the screencap (obscure text, draw arrows and circles, ...)
before you actually grab it. Then save it or paste it into a deck, no further messing around
needed. Dan Kegel would say: You want it. 



## Philosophy of documentation


The *philosophy* is the "Proofs from the Book" normative statement: There is an optimal path in presenting 
a complex topic. `nexus` is centered on tech, tools and methods of open science; and having ideas on documentation
is part of that, i.e. not just "document how to start a VM" but "document my code" and "document
my code's performance" and so on.
