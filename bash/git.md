# git

## The three levels of `git`


- Level 1 main (bulldozer) idea: Requires a basic set of six commands
- Level 2 mezzanine idea: Stashing and resolving conflicts
- Level 3 advanced uses: GitHub integration, branching, pull requests, actions, ... 


### Level 1 Basics

I want to start a new project with its own hermetic *repository*. I do this on the GitHub website to create
an empty repository; perhaps with a `README.md` file and a use license like the MIT one. So far so good...
but what am I going to get out of doing this empty box business? 

- `git clone` makes a local copy of a GitHub repo

### Level 2 Resolving conflicts

### Level 3 GitHub integration
