# cloud


This stub page will evolve into primarily a baseline message and a directory of cloud sub-page content. 


Cloud computing for research comes at a dollar cost. We are interested in optimizing spend.

* Preemptible instance use on the cloud (70-90% savings)
    * [Dedicated notes here in nexus](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus/edit/gh-pages/cloud/spot.md)
    * [Oorjit's repo on ML using preemptible VMs](https://github.com/oorjitchowdhary/ml-training-preemptible-vms/blob/main/README.md)

* 23-JAN-2025 11:30AM PDT **Checkpointing methods: Getting $3.33 of cloud compute for $1.00**
    * [connect link], [recording link]  
    * Abstract: In todayâ€™s busy world we can lose track of small details that have a big impact.
Suppose you have a cloud budget of $10,000 but your computations could be scaled up beyond
that limitation to produce better research. What you need is access to immutable storage (easy),
access to cheap preemptible cloud VM instances (easy) and a reliable method of checkpointing
your progress (easy? hard?). This one-two-three punch means you can purchase $33,333 worth of
cloud computing for a mere $10,000 and get better research results as a consequence. This cloud
clinic will catch you up on the how-tos and other small details of such a substantial gain in
compute power. We use a CNN as our example implementation of a compute-intensive research task.
