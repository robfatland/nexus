# azure

The Azure cloud has a great deal to recommend. This includes integration with the VSCode IDE and a considerable
wealth of integrated solutions. At UW we have been using Azure to teach engineering students the principles 
and practices of cloud computing. This includes storage basics, NoSQL databases, serverless functions, containerization
and the use of on-demand virtual machines.
