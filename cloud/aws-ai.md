# AWS AI


This page contains notes from working through AI labs found at [this AWS-maintained website](https://workshops.aws).
Here I use AI in the broad definition sense; incorporating Machine Learning methods particularly.


### Free-form exploration


- Log in to AWS, go to the SageMaker service
- Select **`Create a Unified Studio Domain`** as this has an aura of one-stop shopping
    - Scroll down a bit: Notice it suggests creating a new VPC > Used all defaults > Create Stack
        - `SageMakerUnifiedStudio-VPC`  
    - **`How do you want to set up your domain?`** > Quick Setup > Defaults with one exception
        - One exception: 'Make your data discoverable'
        - Looks good > Create Domain > Success > Open Unified Studio > Landing Page
            - Discover
            - Build
            - Learn About
