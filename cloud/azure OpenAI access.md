The Azure cloud integrates with the VSCode IDE features access to LLMs via API calls.


Note: At the University of Washington we have used the Azure platform for instruction on how to build and operate
cloud-based computing infrastructure. These 'principles and practices of cloud computing' include storage basics,

and the management and use of on-demand virtual machines.
