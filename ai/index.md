# artificial intelligence


This page touches on the *broad* definition of artificial intelligence as forms of autonomous computation. 
This big region on the AI Euler diagram encompasses all manners and forms of AI: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, 
Convolutional Neural Networks, Supervised and Unsupervised forms of training, clustering algorithms such as 
K-means and so forth.


The related sub-pages linked above -- *gcp*, *aws* and *azure* -- are AI notes on cloud-specific technology stacks.

    - Bedrock
    - Foundation Model emphasis
    - Anthropic > Claude
    - Dedicated hardware: Trainium, Inferentia
- Azure
    - AI Foundry
    - AI Studio
    - ML Studio
- GCP
    - Gemini: An LLM
    - Vertex AI: A platform for building, training and deploying AI models
