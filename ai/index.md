# artificial intelligence


...is discussed here in the *broad* sense and tradition of autonomous computation, in many different forms. This is 
the big region on an AI Euler diagram that encompasses Machine Learning, Deep Learning, CNNs, Supervised and Unsupervised
training, K-means and so on and so on; in other words AI is the term for a profusion of tools and methods. In this sense
AI resembles or reflects human modes of thought; a high-level analogy that can be somewhat impractical or misleading. 


Note: In contrast to the broad definition of AI I indicate the sub-category of *generative* AI -- including Large Language Models -- using *'gen-AI'*.
