# artificial intelligence


...is discussed here in the *broad* sense and tradition of autonomous computation, in many different forms. This is 
the big circle on the AI Euler diagram that includes Machine Learning, CNNs, K-means algorithms and so on; a profusion
of tools. In this definition of AI the various methods resemble or reflect human thought; but this analogy is at
a high level somewhat vague and impractical. Anyway the central point is that *AI* writ large is an ensemble of methods 
for data analysis. (In contrast I indicate *generative* AI including Large Language Models and so on as *gen-AI*.
