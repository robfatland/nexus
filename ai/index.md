# artificial intelligence...


...is defined here in the broad tradition of -- in some sense -- autonomous computation, the biggest circle of the Euler
diagram. That this in some way resembles human thought is an analogy, but one that is not particularly practical or
constructive. *AI* writ large is an ensemble of methods for data analysis. In contrast, *generative AI* (Large Language Models 
and so forth) is indicated *gen-AI*.
