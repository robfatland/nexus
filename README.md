# **nexus** 

...is a *threefold documentation resource* for open research: *native*, *external* via URL pointers, 
and *hybrid* documentation. *Hybrid* is commentary from working an external tutorial: To fill context gaps, 
note gotchas and so on: Make the path easier to follow.


- This is [`main:README.md` for nexus](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus).
- For content go to the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus/tree/gh-pages).
- Static site published at [https://robfatland.github.io/nexus](https://robfatland.github.io/nexus).


## motivation


[This repo](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus/tree/main) is motivated by frustration: With sorting out
a technical task; then writing out notes; then losing those notes; then coming back to the task three months
later; then start over. Now the idea is to build the nexus static website from github pages. Theme is
open science in practice, particularly how to build research computing cyberinfrastructure.
