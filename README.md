# [nexus](https://robfatland.github.io/nexus/)


[This repo](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus/tree/main) began as a note on simplifying 
the *Bourne again shell* (**`bash`**) interface: Eliminate the garish colorized text in favor 
of green characters on a black background.


This page is the meta-narrative. To get to the point:


- [nexus repo documentation: The `gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus/tree/gh-pages)
- [nexus as a compiled site](https://robfatland.github.io/nexus).


The published content for the nexus repo takes precedence for content presentation.
Here -- meanwhile -- is an aspirational snapshot of what nexus would like to connect with:


- customizing `bash` and `vi` to back of the garish interface

    - headless `jupyter` running on a cloud VM with a localhost laptop interface
- Comparison: **`miniconda`** versus **`anaconda`**
