You are reading meta-narrative for the nexus repo. **nexus** content resides in the `gh-pages` branch.


# [nexus](https://robfatland.github.io/nexus/)


[This repo](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus/tree/main) began as documentation for simplifying 
the appearance of the **`bash`** interface: Disable the garish colorized text... just green characters 
on a black background please. It has now become a documentation resource: Where to get help on
tasks common to the data science research process.


To get to the point:


- [nexus content `gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus/tree/gh-pages)
- [nexus published website](https://robfatland.github.io/nexus).
- [nexus 'main' branch](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus).
