**nexus** is a *threefold documentation resource* for open research: *native*, *external* via URL pointers, 
and *hybrid*. Hybrid documentation is commentary generated when working through an external resource such 
as a tutorial. This is intended to fill context gaps, note gotchas and so on: Make the path easier to follow.


This is the [meta-narrative for nexus](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus), main branch `README.md`. 
<br> **nexus** source is the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus/tree/gh-pages).
<br> **nexus** publishes at [https://robfatland.github.io/nexus](https://robfatland.github.io/nexus).


# [nexus](https://robfatland.github.io/nexus/)


[This repo](https://github.com/robfatland/nexus/tree/main) is motivated by frustration: With sorting out
some technical detail, writing out notes, losing the notes, and coming back to the same task three months
later. The process to deal with this is to build the nexus static website using github pages. Themes are
all within the topic of open science practice and how to build research computing cyberinfrastructure.


## Example motivating tasks


- How do I manage Python environments?
- How do I publish my oceanography code as a Python package?
- How do I build an API-based resource?
- How do I safely manage sensitive data?
- How do I manage my code development in relation to my GitHub repository?
- How do I turn off colorization in `bash` and `vi`? Just green on black please.
- How do I set up a cloud VM as my power workstation and use Jupyter there from my laptop?


## nexus aspirations (the to-do list)


- TCOTU: Understanding, building, maintaining, using Python environments
    - corollary: customizing `bash`, `vi` to a simple appearance
    - **`ssh`** tunnels from one machine to another
    - headless `jupyter` running on a cloud VM with a localhost laptop interface
- Comparison: **`miniconda`** versus **`anaconda`**
- PC-based Linux / IDE: **`Ubuntu bash`**, **`WSL-2`**, **`VSCode`**
    - Containerization
    - conda environments
- cloud infrastructure building
        - Data systems, APIs
        - Building a Flask server
